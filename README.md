Write a command line node app get_sums_of_all_ints_except_at_index.js () that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the sums. Do not use subtraction in your solution.

[10:19] 
[1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

[14, 8, 12, 11]

by calculating:

[7+3+4, 1+3+4, 1+7+4, 1+7+3]

notice that for the first element of the array we don't add 1.
